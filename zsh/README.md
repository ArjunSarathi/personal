# wolffy's zsh :0
## Quick Installation
NOTE: If you don't have `zsh` already installed, it will want sudo permission
```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL zsh.wolff.sh)
```
or if you don't have `sudo` privileges, you can create a local installation.  
If you change your mind about `zsh` after running the first script, run `chsh -s /bin/bash && bash`.  
If you change your mind after running the latter, edit `~/.bashrc` and delete the last line, then run the command `bash`
```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL nosudo.wolff.sh)
```
